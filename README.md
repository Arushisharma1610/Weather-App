# Weather-App
<br>
This is a weather app that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with up-to-date weather information for their location or any location they search for.
<br>
<b>Features: </b>
<br>
 ➤ Current Weather: Displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover, along with a brief description of the weather conditions.<br>
 

 ➤ Location Detection: Automatically detects the user's location using geolocation API, or users can manually search for a location.<br>

 ➤ User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to access and understand the weather information.<br>
